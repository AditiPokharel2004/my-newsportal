    <h4>Neuralink's First Human Patient Able to Control Mouse Through Thinking, Says Elon Musk
    </h4>
    <p2>
        The first human patient implanted with a brain-chip from Neuralink appears to have fully recovered and is able to control a computer mouse using their thoughts, the startup's founder Elon Musk said late on Monday.

        "Progress is good, and the patient seems to have made a full recovery, with no ill effects that we are aware of. Patient is able to move a mouse around the screen by just thinking," Musk said in a Spaces event on social media platform X.
        
        Musk said Neuralink was now trying to get as many mouse button clicks as possible from the patient.
        Neuralink did not immediately reply to Reuters' request for further details.

The firm successfully implanted a chip on its first human patient last month, after receiving approval for human trial recruitment in September.

The study uses a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface implant in a region of the brain that controls the intention to move, Neuralink has said, adding that the initial goal is to enable people to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts.

    <h5>Meta Shows Small Businesses New Ways to Bypass Apple's App Store Fees
    </h5>
    <p3>Meta is advising the companies to buy ads through a web browser, rather than on Facebook or Instagram iOS apps, according to guidance released Thursday. That will help them avoid an Apple commission that Meta said would take effect this month.

        Apple's new policy requires advertisers to use its In-App Purchase feature whenever they pay to “boost” social media posts — a move that gives the content more exposure. Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% on app purchases in its iOS software, meaning that Meta will lose a portion of its ad revenue to the iPhone maker.
        The policy change, first announced by Apple in 2022, ratcheted up tension between the tech giants, which have become two of Silicon Valley's biggest adversaries in recent years. At the time, Meta accused the company of “undercutting others in the digital economy.” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also frequently criticized Apple for wielding too much control over its App Store.

    <h6>Google Gemini App on Android, Gemini Toggle on iOS Rolling Out in India and Other Countries</h6>
    <p4>Google has started rolling out its Gemini app on Android to users in India. While there's no dedicated app on iOS, 
        iPhone owners will be able to see a toggle on the top of the Google app, allowing them to enable and utlise the features 
        of the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot. The tech giant launched the Android app on February 8, but the rollout 
        was limited to the US. Now, the app is being expanded to more than 150 countries and territories.
